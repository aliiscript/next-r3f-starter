## ☕✍️ React Three Fiber Next Starter W/TypeScript 

:warning:This is my [official r3f-next starter](https://github.com/aliiscript/next-three-fiber). Will no longer be updating this one. Learned alot and wanted to start fresh! Will leave this up for those who are using it/like it :warning:

First Load is way faster thanks to [RenaudRohlinger](https://github.com/RenaudRohlinger) next.config

## How To Use
Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```
yarn create next-app [project name] -e https://github.com/Alex23925/next-r3f-starter
# or
npx create-next-app [project name] -e https://github.com/Alex23925/next-r3f-starter
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Canvas Component by default is too small so added this class to resize to correct size
Can be removed if you find a better solution to the problem
